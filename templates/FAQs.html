                    how your data is handled, and what features the platform offers.
                    Below are answers to the most common questions to help you understand the system clearly.

                  <h4 class="mt-4">1. What is Resume AI?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI is a Django-based web application that allows users to
                    <strong>build resumes from scratch</strong> using simple inputs
                    as well as <strong>analyze existing resumes</strong> using Artificial Intelligence.
                    It helps improve clarity, structure, and overall resume quality.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">2. Can I create a resume without uploading one?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Yes. Resume AI allows users to generate a complete resume from scratch
                    by entering basic details such as personal information, skills, education,
                    and experience. No existing resume is required.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">3. What file formats can I upload?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI currently supports:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>PDF files (.pdf)</li>
                    <li>Word documents (.docx)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Other formats such as images or plain text files are not supported.
                    PDF format is recommended for best accuracy.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">4. Is my data safe?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Yes. Uploaded resumes and user inputs are processed only for generating
                    results and are not permanently stored.
                    The platform does not share user data with third parties.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">5. How accurate is the AI feedback?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The AI provides suggestions based on standard resume best practices
                    and common industry expectations.
                    The feedback is intended as guidance and should be reviewed and adjusted
                    according to individual career goals and experience.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">6. Can Resume AI guarantee job placement?</h4>
                  <p>
                    No. Resume AI does not guarantee interviews or job offers.
                    It is a support tool designed to improve resume quality,
                    which may increase the chances of making a strong impression.

                  <p>
                    No account is required at this stage.
                    Users can directly build or analyze resumes without registration.
                    Account-based features such as saving resumes and tracking history
                    may be added in future updates.

                    Processing time may vary depending on server load and file size.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">9. Can I use Resume AI on mobile devices?</h4>
