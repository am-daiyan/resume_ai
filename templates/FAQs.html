                    We understand that you may have questions about how <strong>Resume AI</strong> works, 
                    how your data is handled, and what benefits the platform offers.  
                    Below is a detailed list of common questions and answers to help you.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">1. What is Resume AI?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI is a web application built with Django that helps users analyze and improve 
                    their resumes using Artificial Intelligence. It extracts text from resumes, processes 
                    it through an AI model, and provides useful suggestions for improvement.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">2. What file formats can I upload?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Currently, Resume AI supports:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>PDF files (.pdf)</li>
                    <li>Word documents (.docx)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Other formats (like .doc, .txt, or images) are not supported at this time.  
                    We recommend exporting your resume to PDF for the best results.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">3. Is my data safe?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Yes. Protecting your privacy is our top priority. Resumes are only processed 
                    temporarily for analysis and are not permanently stored.  
                    We do not share your documents with third parties.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    <a href="{% url 'privacy_policy' %}">Privacy Policy</a>.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">4. How accurate are the AI suggestions?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The AI provides feedback based on recognized best practices in resume writing, 
                    but the suggestions should be considered guidance, not absolute rules.  
                    Users should review and adapt the recommendations to match their own experiences 
                    and career goals.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">5. Can Resume AI guarantee me a job?</h4>
                  <p>
                    No. Resume AI is a tool designed to help you improve your resume.  
                    It cannot guarantee job offers, interviews, or employment.  
                    However, by refining your resume, you increase your chances of making a strong impression.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">6. Do I need an account to use Resume AI?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Currently, Resume AI does not require account creation. You can upload your resume directly 
                    and receive analysis. In the future, we may introduce user accounts for saving resumes, 
                    tracking history, and personalized recommendations.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">7. How long does the analysis take?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The analysis is usually completed within a few seconds after you upload your resume.  
                    Processing time may vary slightly depending on file size and server load.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">8. Can I use this on mobile?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Yes! Resume AI is built with Bootstrap for a responsive design, meaning it works smoothly 
                    on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">9. Who developed Resume AI?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI is developed by <strong>Daiyan Ali Abbas</strong> as a learning and demonstration project.  
                    The goal is to combine Django with Artificial Intelligence to create a practical web application.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">10. Will this always remain free?</h4>
                  <p>
                    At present, Resume AI is free to use as an educational and demonstration project.  
                    In the future, additional premium features may be introduced, but the basic analysis 
                    will remain accessible.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">11. Can I suggest new features?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Absolutely! User feedback is valuable. If you have feature suggestions, 
                    improvements, or encounter issues, you can reach out through the 
                    <a href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">Contact Page</a>.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">12. What should I do if I face an error?</h4>
                  <p>
                    If something doesn’t work as expected (such as file not uploading, or analysis failing), 
                    try the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensure your file is in PDF or DOCX format.</li>
                    <li>Check that the file is not too large or corrupted.</li>
                    <li>Refresh the page and try again.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    If the problem persists, contact the developer for support.
                  </p>
