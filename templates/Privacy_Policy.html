                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h4>
                  <p>
                    The collected information is used strictly for the following purposes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Generating resumes based on user inputs.</li>

                    <li>Enhancing application performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">3. Data Storage and Retention</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI does not permanently store uploaded resumes or generated resume data.
                    Information is processed temporarily to generate results and is discarded
                    after processing is complete, unless future features explicitly state otherwise.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">4. Data Security</h4>
                  <p>
                    We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect
                    your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
                    Your data is never sold or shared for marketing purposes.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">5. Third-Party Services</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resume AI may use third-party Artificial Intelligence APIs to analyze text
                    or generate resume content. Only the minimum required data is sent to
                    these services for processing, and they are not permitted to retain or
                    reuse your data.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">6. Your Rights</h4>
                  <p>
                    You retain full control over your data. Since resume data is processed
                    temporarily, users may discontinue use at any time without concern of
                    long-term data storage.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
                  <p>
                    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect improvements
                    or changes in functionality. Any updates will be posted on this page.
