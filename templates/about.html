                      Resume AI is a Django-based web application that helps users both
                      <strong>build professional resumes from scratch</strong> and
                      <strong>analyze existing resumes</strong> using Artificial Intelligence.
                      The goal is to remove confusion from resume creation and provide
                      clear, practical improvements that actually matter.

                      Users can generate a complete resume by simply entering basic details
                      such as skills, education, and experience, or upload an existing resume
                      to receive intelligent feedback, strengths analysis, and improvement suggestions.
                      The system focuses on clarity, structure, and job-readiness.
