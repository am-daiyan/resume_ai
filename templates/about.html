                      Resume AI is a Django-based web application designed to help users analyze and improve their resumes using Artificial Intelligence.
                      The goal is to simplify resume reviews, highlight strengths, and provide actionable suggestions.

                      This project is built to demonstrate how AI models can be integrated with Django to create
                      real-world applications. It extracts text from uploaded PDF and DOCX files, sends it to an AI API for analysis,
                      and displays a clean preview of recommendations.
